# Space Exploration Dataset Project Progress Log

## Initial Setup 

- Initialized Git repository
- Selected dataset topic: Space Exploration Missions (1970-1999)
- Decided on data structure:
  - Year
  - Mission Name
  - Mission Type (Categorical: Lunar, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.)
  - Mission Success (Boolean)
  - Participating Countries (Categorical)
  - Scientific Discoveries (Numeric score or significance)

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Dataset Creation
- Created comprehensive dataset of space exploration missions from 1970-1999
- Included details like mission name, type, success status, participating countries, and scientific impact
- Stored data in CSV format for easy access and manipulation

### Step 2: Script Development
- Implemented analyze.py with the following features:
  - CSV data loading with error handling
  - Prime number and divisibility filtering functions
  - Column-based filtering for all data attributes
  - Formatted display of results
  - Summary statistics generation
  - Visualization of success rates using matplotlib

### Step 3: Testing
- Created test_analyze.py with pytest to test core functionality:
  - Prime number detection
  - Divisibility calculation
  - Data loading
  - Various filtering functions
- Used fixtures to generate test data
- Added test cases for edge cases and error conditions

### Step 4: Documentation
- Created comprehensive README with:
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Command-line argument details
  - Testing instructions
- Added inline documentation to all functions

## Design Decisions

### Data Structure
- Chose CSV format for simplicity and compatibility
- Included a mix of categorical and numerical data for robust analysis
- Used boolean for success status for clear filtering
- Added scientific impact score (0-10) to allow for quantitative analysis

### Code Organization
- Used modular function design for testability
- Separated data loading, filtering, display, and visualization functions
- Created dedicated functions for prime and divisibility checks
- Used argparse for clean command-line interface

### Additional Features
- Added summary statistics to provide deeper insights
- Implemented visualization capabilities with matplotlib
- Added ability to save charts to files
- Included robust error handling throughout

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Consider adding more sophisticated statistical analysis
- Add time-series trend visualization
- Implement export functionality for filtered data
- Add more unit tests for edge cases
- Consider adding interactive visualization elements
